# Option Pricing and Derivative Strategy Design on Reliance Industries

This repository contains the source code and project report for analyzing option prices and designing derivative trading strategies for Reliance Industries (RELIANCE.NS). The project utilizes Python to implement theoretical models such as the Black-Scholes formula and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate market strategies under varying conditions.

## Project Objective

- Compute option prices using theoretical models.
- Simulate market outcomes under volatility.
- Design and evaluate trading strategies to optimize returns.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Historical price data, spot prices, and option chain data for Reliance Industries were gathered using Python libraries.

2. **Market Premium Calculation**:  
   The average bid and ask prices for call and put options were calculated to determine market premiums.

3. **Volatility Analysis**:  
   - Historical volatility: Computed from daily percentage returns and their standard deviations.
   - Implied volatility: Derived using the Black-Scholes model, ensuring market and theoretical parity.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:  
   Simulated stock price paths using a geometric Brownian motion model to evaluate future outcomes.

5. **Strategy Design**:  
   Analyzed various derivative strategies such as Bull Call Spread, Long Straddle, and Covered Calls to identify the optimal trading approach.

## Results Summary

- **Market Observations**:  
  Call premiums are significantly higher than put premiums, indicating bullish market sentiment. However, implied call volatilities were low, suggesting pricing mismatches.

- **Chosen Strategy**:  
  The **Long Straddle** strategy was selected for its potential to profit from significant price movements in either direction. A biased approach favoring underpriced puts was implemented for additional gains.

- **Simulation Insights**:  
  Simulated price paths revealed strong upward or downward movements, which align with the Long Straddle's profit potential.
